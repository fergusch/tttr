A Rust implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe with AI gameplay.

The current AI uses the [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to calculate its moves. Plans to include other algorithms such as [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) and [principal variation search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_variation_search) are to be implemented for comparison.

### To-do
[] Improve heuristic of minimax AI
[] Implement other algorithms
